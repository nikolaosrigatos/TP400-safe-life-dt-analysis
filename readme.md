- Code contains all the MATLAB files
 - FAD_config1.m calculates the Failure Assessment Diagram (FAD) for configuration one (shown in TP400_Nikolaos_Rigatos.pdf, slide 18)
 - FAD_config2.m calculates the Failure Assessment Diagram (FAD) for configuration two (shown in TP400_Nikolaos_Rigatos.pdf, slide 18)
 - MC_inspection_plan.m performs a Monte Carlo (MC) analysis to produce a probabilistic inspection plan
 - PND_MC.m and PND_calc.m calculate the Probability of Non-Detection (PND) for the MC analysis and the deterministic damage-tolerance analysis
 - TP400.m is the main file that runs all functions
 - damage_calc.m performs a top-of-the-scatter life calculation
 - inspection_plan_profile1.m calculates the inspections required to achieve a PND of less than 2e-5
 - interpolate_curves.m interpolates the crack-versus-cycles graphs extracted from NASGRO
 - loglik_3par_norm_runouts.m calculates the log-likelihood function for the S-N curve
 - prob_assessment.m performs a probabilistic top-of-the-scatter assessment
 - prob_damage_tol.m performs the probabilistic damage-tolerance analysis for a probability of exceedance of 2e-5
 - write_SF_files.m writes the NASGRO files required for the deterministic damage-tolerance analysis
- Fatigue Data contains the Excel files for the S-N curve
- Mission Profiles contains the mean and alternating stress data for each mission profile
- Monte Carlo contains the crack-versus-cycles data for different initial crack lengths, used for interpolation via interpolate_curves
- NAGRO contains the NASGRO results for Task 2
- PDF contains all PDFs used for bibliography, tasks, and references
- POD Curves contains the probability-of-detection data for each inspection tool
- Results contains the .png files of all results
- SF_NASGRO contains the NASGRO input files for Task 2
- TP_400_Nikolaos_Rigatos.pdf and TP_400_Nikolaos_Rigatos.pptx are the short presentations of the project
