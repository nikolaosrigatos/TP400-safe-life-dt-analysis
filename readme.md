- Code has all the MATLAB files
   - FAD_config1.m calculates the Failure Assessment Diagram (FAD) for configuration one (shown in TP400_Nikolaos_rigatos.pdf slide 18)
   - FAD_config2.m calculates the Failure Assessment Diagram (FAD) for configuration two (shown in TP400_Nikolaos_rigatos.pdf slide 18)
   - MC_inspection_plan.m does a Monte Carlo (MC) analysis in order to produce a probabilistic inspection plan
   - PND_MC.m and PND_calc.m calculates the Probability of Non Detection (PND) for the MC analysis and the deterministic damage tolerance analysis
   - TP400.m is the main file which runs all the functions
   - damage_calc.m runs a top of the scatter life calculation approach
   - inspection_plan_profile1.m calculates the required inspections required for a PND of less than 2e-5
   - interpolate_curves.m interpolates the crack vs cycles graphs extracted from NASGRO
   - loglik_3par_norm_runouts calculates the loglik function for the S-N curv e
   - prob_assessment.m does a probabilistic approach of the top of the scatter
   - prob_damage_tol.m does the probabilistic damage tolerance analysis for a probability of exceedance of 2e-5
   - write_SF_files.m writes the NASGRO files required for the deterministic damage tolerance analysis

- Fatigue Data contains the excel files for the S-N curve
- Mission Profiles contains the mean and alternating stress data for each mission profile
- Monte Carlo contains the crack vs cycles given different initial crack lengths. Used to interpolate the data using interpolate_curves.
- NAGRO contains the NASGRO results for Task 2
- PDF contains all the pdfs used for bibliography, the tasks etc.
- POD curves contains the probability for detection data for each inspection tool
- Results contains the .png of all results
- SF_NASGRO contains the NASGRO files to be ran for Task 2
- TP_400_Nikolaos_Rigatos.pdf and TP_400_Nikolaos_Rigatos.pptx are the short presentation of the project.
